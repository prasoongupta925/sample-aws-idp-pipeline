"""Builds the compact public data of app/branches.py (app/data/branches, see its README.md).

Inputs, both open data (licences in app/data/branches/README.md):
- India Post's All India Pincode Directory with latitude and longitude, published on
  data.gov.in under the Government Open Data License - India: one row per post office.
- IFSC.csv of a razorpay/ifsc release: RBI's list of bank branches (IFSC), public domain.

Outputs (gzip JSON, byte-for-byte the same for the same inputs):
- pincode_directory.json.gz: every pincode's delivery office, district, state and centre.
  Some offices have wrong coordinates (a typo, a copy of the head office's, the sea, or
  degrees-minutes-seconds written as a decimal: 22.3434 for 22 deg 34' 34"), and whole
  postal divisions gave all their offices one point (a town's, or a typo: 12 Pune offices
  sit 55 km west of Pune, 9 Mumbai ones at Malabar Hill), so a point that offices of
  SHARED_POINT_PINCODES or more pincodes share is nobody's own: it never makes a neighbour
  centre and is used only for a pincode with no point of its own. The centre is the median
  of its offices' own points that lie near the neighbouring pincodes (same first four
  digits, else three: the median of their offices' own unambiguous points, within
  max(MIN_RADIUS_KM, 2 x their median distance to it)), each office read the way that puts
  it nearest them, and moved to its head and sub offices when they are within TOWN_KM of
  that median, or when the points do not agree at all (the town, where the branches are).
  The district's offices are the last neighbours tried (an island district shares its
  first digits with the mainland). Else 3+ offices that agree, if not too far. Else, with
  approx = 1: the shared points that agree with the nearest neighbours, else the
  district's centre.
- bank_branches.json.gz: the own branches (IFSC XXXX0 + six digits) of HDFC Bank, ICICI
  Bank and Axis Bank with the pincode parsed from the published address. A branch whose
  address has no pincode the directory knows cannot be placed and is left out, and so are
  back-office units (service branches, card operations, treasury, currency chests ...).
  Names, cities and addresses are re-cased for display; otherwise as published.

Usage (from packages/backend; downloads the inputs that are not given):
    uv run python scripts/build_branch_data.py [--pincode-csv FILE] [--ifsc-csv FILE]
