"""Erase one applicant (DPDP right to erasure).

POST /projects/{project_id}/applicants/erase deletes every document the file
check attributes to one applicant, with exactly the cleanup of
DELETE /projects/{project_id}/documents/{document_id} (the same function runs):
the S3 objects, the LanceDB vectors, the knowledge-graph delete queue and the
DynamoDB items (document, workflow, facts). A LanceDB delete only hides rows,
so the erase then starts the LanceDB service's optimize on the project's table
(asynchronously), which deletes the files still holding them; the nightly
retention sweep optimizes every table too, so they are physically gone within
a day even when that start fails.

The applicant's documents come from the file-check Lambda's read-only
applicant_documents tool, which groups documents like the verdict (PAN first,
else a compatible name), so the erase removes what the verdict shows under
that applicant, no more and no fewer. Documents that belong to no applicant in
the verdict (still being analysed, failed, without facts, spreadsheets,
unassigned) are not touched. The applicant's saved eligibility inputs (the
CIBIL page: PAN, mobile, DOB, addresses, income, loans; ELIG# items saved
under the PAN or the name) and the needs-review items a person confirmed for
them (FCCONF# items: who confirmed which checklist item) are deleted too.

The caller must repeat the applicant's name, as the verdict shows it, in
`confirm`, and list the documents it confirmed in `document_ids`: the grouping
is done again at request time, so when documents joined or left the applicant
since the check, nothing is deleted (409). The applicant's name is also
removed from the project's webhook delivery log (WHDLV# items), and the
project's active customer upload links are revoked. Not erased
here, and listed in `not_erased`: chat conversations and artifacts that
mention the applicant (the retention sweep deletes them after the retention
period) and verdicts the webhook already sent to the CRM.

One audit item with counts only (no name, PAN, document ids or caller) is
written as PROJ#{project_id} / ERASE#{timestamp}#{uuid}; DynamoDB TTL on
expires_at removes it after the retention period (default 7 days).
