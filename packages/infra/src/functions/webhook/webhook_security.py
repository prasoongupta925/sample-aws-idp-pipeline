"""Webhook URL checks, request signing and signing secrets (standard library only).

This file ships twice and the two copies must stay byte-identical (the backend
and the Lambda test suites both compare them):

- packages/backend/app/webhook_security.py: checks the URL on
  PUT /projects/{id}/integrations/webhook and generates the signing secret;
- packages/infra/src/functions/webhook/webhook_security.py: the delivery Lambda
  checks the URL again, checks every resolved address and signs the request.

The backend image and the Lambda asset are packaged from different folders, so
the module is copied instead of imported across packages.

URL rules (validate_webhook_url): https only, port 443 (the default) or 8443,
at most 2048 characters, ASCII only, no credentials, no fragment. The host is a
public DNS name (two labels or more, not localhost / *.local / *.internal) or a
public IP literal: loopback, private, link-local (169.254.0.0/16, with the
instance metadata address 169.254.169.254), unique-local (fd00:ec2::254),
shared (100.64.0.0/10), multicast, reserved and IPv4-in-IPv6 transition
addresses (IPv4-compatible, IPv4-translated, NAT64, 6to4, Teredo) are refused,
IPv6 must be global unicast (2000::/3), and non-canonical IPv4 spellings such as
2130706433 or 0x7f.1 are refused too.

At send time resolve_public_addresses resolves the host once and refuses the
delivery when any address is not public; the sender then connects to those
addresses only, so the DNS answer cannot change between the check and the
connection.

Signature header: t=<unix seconds>,v1=<hex HMAC-SHA256(key=secret as UTF-8,
message=f"{t}." + raw request body)>. A receiver recomputes it over the raw body
bytes, compares in constant time and rejects timestamps more than 5 minutes
away from its clock (verify_signature).

Secrets at rest: the backend encrypts a new secret with the webhook KMS key
(WebhookStack) and stores only the ciphertext; the delivery Lambda is the only
role that may decrypt it. Both use secret_encryption_context(project_id), so a
ciphertext only decrypts for its own project.
